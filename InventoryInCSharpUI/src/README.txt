TODO: 
Make it so that add Item to pantry button is on screen without having to scroll. The UX design is terrible right now. 
make cancel button work
search pantries in pantry contents
add pantry on pantry content page.
Make it scale to half screen. list of pantries in myPantries is messed up. add item to pantry button disappears.


nicety:
what pantry is item in.
show quantity that is in house on item page?
number of items in pantry on pantry content (as tooltip?).

completed:
dont let quantity go bellow 1. make logic on backend to delete item when quantity edited to be 0?
make sure item and pantry can be deleted without messing up pantry contents.
make everything react suite.
