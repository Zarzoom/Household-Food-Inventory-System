# End Goal
Household food inventory is an aplication to manage the items that are in your pantry and your shoping list. Add Items with details such as the brand, quantity, and price. Then organize them into pantries such as fridge, freezer, and cupboard. Have you finished an item and need more? Add it to your handy grocery list and make your next shoping trip a breeze.

# Current Status
The app allows items to be added to a database and subsequently managed. Features available for management include updating current items, searching using the primary key, and incomplete versions of the brand and generic name. 

# ToDo
Price wont take in anything less than one. It needs to take in a number less than 1.
